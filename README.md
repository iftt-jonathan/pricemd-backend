# pricemd-backend
This is the repository for the backend of PriceMD
Tech stack: AWS Lambda serverless, Python runtime, S3 for data storage
Goals:
 - Get CI pipeline going
 - Get working Lambda uploads
 - Set up API to call dummy hospital CSV info and test on frontend
 - Set up some testing to make sure we don't break anything
 - Flesh out API from there
